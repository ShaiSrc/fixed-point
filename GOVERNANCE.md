# Governance

This project follows a **BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life)** model, which is common for focused libraries maintained by a single author.

## BDFL

@ShaiDev (the project owner) has final authority over technical direction, releases, and governance decisions.

## Maintainers

As the project grows, maintainers may be delegated responsibilities like triage, code review, and release preparation.

## Decision Process

- Discussions happen in issues and pull requests
- I seek consensus where possible and value community input
- When consensus isn't reached, I make the final call

## Succession

If I'm unable to maintain the project long-term, I'll either:

- Transfer ownership to a trusted maintainer, or
- Archive the repository with clear notice

## Changes to Governance

I'm the only one who can update this governance model. If the project grows significantly, I'll revisit this structure.
